This is the Common Lisp code walker that was originally written by
Marco Baringer in his Arnesi library. With his permission it was
factored out into a standalone cl-walker library and further developed
by Attila Lendvai. Also contains important contribution to the
environment handling by Berki Lukács Tamás. Please consult the repo
history for more details.

This code walker parses a lisp sexp into CLOS objects which is very
convenient representation to do various code transformations using
generic methods.

There's also an unwalker provided that can convert back the CLOS
instances into lisp sexps.
