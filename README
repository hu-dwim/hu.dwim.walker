This is a code walker that parses a Common Lisp sexp into a tree of
CLOS objects, which is a much more convenient representation to do
various code analysis and transformations than cons based sexps. Also
features an unwalker that can turn the walked CLOS AST tree back into
an sexp.

It was originally written by Marco Baringer in his Arnesi
library. With his permission it was first factored out into a
standalone cl-walker library and then renamed to hu.dwim.walker as
part of a broad refactoring of all our (http://dwim.hu) libs.

Contains important contribution by several people, please consult the
history of the source repository for more details.
