This is a code walker that parses a Common Lisp sexp into a tree of
CLOS objects, which is a much more convenient representation to do
various code analysis and transformations than cons based sexps. Also
features an unwalker that can turn the walked CLOS AST tree into an
sexp.

It that was originally written by Marco Baringer in his Arnesi
library. With his permission it was first factored out into a
standalone cl-walker library and then renamed to hu.dwim.walker as
part of a broad refactoring of all our (http://dwim.hu) libs.

Also contains important contribution to the environment handling by
Berki Lukács Tamás. Please consult the repo history for more details.
